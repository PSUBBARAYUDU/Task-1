## Task 1 Completion Note:

I have successfully completed Task 1 of my Full Stack Web Development Internship, which involved designing and developing a modern, visually appealing, and fully responsive landing page. The webpage includes a structured header with navigation and dropdown menu, an engaging hero section with a clear call-to-action, a features section using icons and cards, and a well-organized footer. I applied modern UI/UX practices using Google Fonts, gradients, hover effects, and a consistent color scheme. This task helped me strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, responsive design, and frontend layout structuring, providing a strong foundation for upcoming full stack tasks.
